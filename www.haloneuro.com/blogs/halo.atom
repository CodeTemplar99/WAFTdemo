      <![CDATA[<h3>Premier music institution joins forces with neurotech innovator to understand how musicians can use brain stimulation to enhance skill and creativity.</h3>
<p>This summer, <a href="https://www.berklee.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Berklee College of Music</a> launched a collaboration with <a href="https://www.haloneuro.com/">Halo Neuroscience</a>, creators of Halo Sport—the first ever consumer brain stimulator that accelerates muscle memory development. Together, Berklee and Halo are exploring how brain stimulation helps musicians optimize their practice and develop musical technique and creativity faster.</p>
<p>The collaboration between Berklee and Halo Neuroscience stems from a number of recently published neuroscience papers looking at the mechanism in the brain that allows musicians to master the motor skills they need to play the right notes at the right time. These double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (referenced below) show that brain stimulation has the potential to accelerate a musician’s ability to learn musical technique and even foster creativity. Berklee and Halo’s goal is to evaluate the power of brain stimulation in a real-world setting, and bring this technology to musicians everywhere.</p>
<img alt="" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0037/7965/7840/files/Guitar_Berklee_Halo_3_flipped_medium.jpg?v=1568050908" style="float: right;">
<p>“We’re excited to have this opportunity to advance our understanding of how musical skills develop in the brain,” said Panos A. Panay, Senior Vice President for Global Strategy and Innovation at Berklee. <strong>“The potential to accelerate music learning and unleash creativity through transcranial electric stimulation, combined with Halo’s beyond-cutting edge technology, is one of the most exciting things we can bring to the next generation of music makers. Our goal is to explore how brain stimulation can help musicians in ways that were once just a distant pipe dream.”</strong></p>
<p>The new collaboration kicked off with a summer fellowship, during which two Berklee students, plus guest participants from Stanford University and Yale University, wrote, practiced, and played music measuring brain activity and using neurostimulation technology to enhance their productivity and streamline their learning.</p>
<p>Alyse Brown, a summer fellow who graduated from the Boston Conservatory at Berklee with a bachelor’s degree in music and a minor in psychology, used Halo Sport to <a href="https://www.haloneuro.com/learn-guitar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">learn guitar for the first time</a>. “With Halo Sport, I was able to face my fears and learn guitar in just eight weeks. I even performed a duet with a friend in front of 50 people at the end of the summer! I’ve gained so much confidence since I started practicing with Halo Sport, and I hope other musicians at Berklee will have the opportunity to benefit from it as well. This could be just the thing that takes musicians to the next level.”</p>
<p>Another student, Lily Dowling, a singer-songwriter currently going into her third year at Berklee College, used a different type of stimulation to improve her songwriting efficiency. <strong>“I never thought I would be incorporating brain stimulation into my songwriting process, let alone see such a big difference. With Halo’s technology, I was able to quadruple the number of songs I could write per week!”</strong></p>
<p>Dr. Brett Wingeier, Halo co-founder and Co-CEO, comments: “We’re thrilled to work with Berklee to improve musicians’ motor skills and accelerate their musical training. The next step will be exploring ways transcranial electric stimulation can affect attention and focus. Recent literature suggests that specific patterns of stimulation applied to cognitive areas of the brain could potentially help unlock more creativity for solos and songwriting.” </p>
<p>Following this summer’s fellowship, the two institutions will look to continue learning how different types of brain stimulation including transcranial direct current stimulation, transcranial alternating current stimulation, and transcranial random noise stimulation can help musicians increase technical ability, creativity, and focus.</p>

<h4>An overview of the goals I achieved with Halo Sport 2.</h4>
<p><em>Welcome back! My name is Alyse, and I'm conquering my fears by learning guitar — in just 8 weeks. If you want to witness my journey from start to finish, read my first three blogs <a href="https://www.haloneuro.com/learn-guitar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Click, click. Whoosh. There was nowhere to go but forward. My stomach filled with butterflies as I braced for what was about to come.</p>
<p>You know that feeling you get on a roller coaster? The one where the bar clicks down on your lap and you realize there's no escaping. You’re filled with fear as the clicking sound of chains pushes you up the mountain... then suddenly you’re flying.</p>
<p>That’s the feeling I’ve had with <a href="https://www.haloneuro.com/products/halo-sport-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Halo Sport</a> this summer. Trying new things is <i>terrifying</i>. What if I fail? What if I tell everyone I'm going to do it... and then I can’t? Disappointment has always been my greatest fear. But you know what? I finally faced my fears. <strong>Not only did I learn guitar, but I also tried aerial yoga, cycled my way to the front of spin class, and most recently broke my record at Flywheel by achieving 7th place.</strong></p>
<p>Throughout my journey, I tried to track my progress scientifically. I learned some chords with real Halo Sport 2 stimulation, and some chords with placebo stimulation. Unfortunately, we chose the wrong measure to assess my performance, so the data came out <em>really</em> wonky. I'm bummed we couldn't quantify my learning, but I know that I've accomplished way more than I thought I could in just a few weeks.</p>
<p>My original goal was to learn two guitar pieces by the end of the summer, but I decided to raise the stakes and do a duet instead. Singing and playing the guitar at the same time is a tough task. So, adding another person into the mix? That was a major test of my newfound guitar skills <em>and</em> my multitasking abilities.</p>
<p>But I did it! I successfully performed “Dreams” by Fleetwood Mac in front of 50 people. I was SO nervous when I got up to the stage — sweat drops were literally dripping from my hands onto my guitar. But once I pushed through my nerves, I started to play... and you know what? It actually went really well! I definitely made some mistakes, but I felt confident up there... I never imagined I could feel like this playing guitar in front of so many people!</p>
<p>I’m so glad that I decided to take on this challenge 8 weeks ago, and I'm looking forward to continuing my guitar journey with Halo Sport. Maybe one day I'll even be able to shred like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYAoJ2QfKE0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lindsey Buckingham</a>.</p>
I didn’t know how to play the guitar<i> at all </i>when I set out on this journey. Today, I just performed in front of 50 people. And I couldn’t have done it without <a href="https://www.haloneuro.com/products/halo-sport-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Halo Sport 2</a> — the brain stimulator that’s given me the confidence to achieve my goals. <strong>What can you do in 8 weeks?</strong>]]>

<h4>A short story of how neuroscience helped me build the confidence to achieve my goals — and how it can help you too.</h4>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Welcome back! My name is Alyse, and I'm conquering my fears by learning guitar — in just 8 weeks. If you missed my first two blogs, check them out <a href="https://www.haloneuro.com/learn-guitar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.<br></span></i></p>
<p>I could feel the blood rush to my head as my body flipped upside down, grasping at the fabric to find stability, and I thought to myself — is this what confidence is? </p>
<p>Hold on, let’s rewind. I’m <i>loving </i>the way <a href="https://www.haloneuro.com/products/halo-sport-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Halo Sport</a> makes me feel. It’s given me a lot of confidence in my skills as a musician, and I can even sing and play the guitar at the same time now. YES! </p>
<p>Halo Sport has helped me build confidence in <i>so</i> many areas of my life. I love the rush of a good spin class, but I usually stick to the back row. Over these past few weeks, though, I’ve felt faster and stronger than ever — so now I’m choosing the front row bikes.</p>
<p>This week, I decided to really break out of my comfort zone — and take an aerial yoga class. Cardio is my love, but me and balance exercises? HAHA. Funny joke… so I slipped on my lululemon pants and ventured into the world of anti-gravity. </p>
<img alt="" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0037/7965/7840/files/IMG_1173_2_large.JPG?v=1566427406" style="float: right;">
<p>I showed up to the studio Primed and ready to go, where I was greeted by a nice lady who guided me through the entire class. She even gave me personal instructions on how to get a deeper stretch in my hips (which was honestly one of the most painful and liberating things I’ve ever experienced).</p>
<p>My proudest moment came when I did my first handstand — ever! I’ve never been able to do cartwheels or handstands, but today I finally succeeded — and it felt like I was flying (literally). There were some aerial pros in the class who definitely surpassed my abilities by a long shot, but it just felt good knowing that I had built up the confidence to actually follow through with something that I’ve wanted to do for years.</p>
<p>Physical fitness is important, but since using Halo Sport my relationship with fitness is what has really changed. I have the confidence to be in the front row at any class and even try crazy activities like aerial yoga! I’m doing things that I never dreamed I would actually do — all thanks to Halo Sport. And that’s how I mastered the art of confidence.</p>

<h4>A few need-to-know tricks for learning guitar — including how to optimize your brain with neuroscience.</h4>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Welcome back! My name is Alyse, and I'm conquering my fears by learning guitar — in just 8 weeks. If you missed my first blog, check it out <a href="https://www.haloneuro.com/blogs/halo/how-to-learn-guitar-according-to-neuroscience">here</a>.</span></i></p>
<p>I have to admit I’m a little surprised... my mission to learn guitar is <i>a lot</i> of fun so far. I’m definitely not any good yet, but I’m not intimidated anymore. So that’s progress!</p>
<p>The bad part? The guitar has given me some wicked calluses and an odd numbing sensation in my fingers. But I Googled it and found that this should get better over time. So here’s to hoping the internet is right, at least for my fingers’ sake.</p>
<p>I’ve been practicing for a few weeks now, and I’ve picked up a few tips and tricks along the way. If you’re joining me on my journey and learning a new instrument with Halo Sport too, these tips are for you.</p>
<h4>1. What did you say, I can’t hear you. Chocolate?</h4>
<p>If you haven't seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obBjKdhZ7-I" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this famous SpongeBob episode</a>, you're definitely missing out. It was actually the very first thing I thought of when I started practicing with Halo Sport. Halo Sport is a brain stimulator <em>and</em> a high-end pair of headphones, which is awesome at the gym — you can get in the zone fast with your favorite workout jams.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0037/7965/7840/files/Screen_Shot_2019-08-16_at_11.48.28_AM_medium.png?v=1566425176" style="float: right;">But musicians don’t need to tune out the world — actually, quite the opposite. That’s why the Halo Neuroscience team created <a href="https://www.haloneuro.com/collections/frontpage/products/open-ear-pads" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open ear pads</a> — so you can hear almost as well as if you weren't wearing a headset at all. They were easy to install and made such a difference while practicing. If you plan on playing any type of instrument with Halo Sport, you need these ASAP.</p>
<h4>2. The wetter, the better</h4>
<p>When you start your first Neuropriming session, the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/halo-sport/id1145104454" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Halo Sport app</a> prompts you to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mk1RfVqWUo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wet your Primer Band</a>. Okay perfect, easy enough. </p>
<p style="float: right;">But when they say wet, they mean <em>wet</em>. It takes almost a full minute under the faucet for the Primer Band to be ready. If I’m struggling, 9 times out of 10, this is what’s causing my Priming troubles, so pro tip — the wetter, the better. </p>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p style="float: right;">Side note: I also put my Halo Sport on backwards once. Life is complicated, but Priming isn’t. Just make sure to check the orientation of the headset when you put it on — a quick and easy fix.</p>
<p style="float: right;"> </p>
<p style="float: right;"> </p>
<p style="float: right;"> </p>
<h4>3. Consult YouTube</h4>
<p style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0037/7965/7840/files/Screen_Shot_2019-08-16_at_11.48.55_AM_large.png?v=1566425471" style="float: right;">Youtube: the place you go if you want to laugh, cry, or you just have a few hours to kill. It can lead you down a deep hole of procrastination, and it’s no surprise considering there are millions of videos on the platform.</p>
<p style="float: right;">But if you're feeling productive, you can learn pretty much anything with Youtube's vast video library. So of course, it's the first place I looked when I started my journey. Right now, I’m following along with YouTubers <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBNkm8o5LiEVLxO8w0p2sfQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JustinGuitar</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMVcE4tPTXx5ILVjG_KOukg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JamPlay</a> to learn guitar one video at a time. The best part? <strong>It's free!</strong></p>
<p style="float: right;"> </p>
<p>Try my tips and tricks out for yourself. And if you’re still debating whether to join me on my adventure, it’s not too late. Pick up that instrument and get started with <a href="https://www.haloneuro.com/products/halo-sport-2">Halo Sport 2</a> today!</p>
<p>Keep following along — next, see how I'm <a href="https://www.haloneuro.com/blogs/halo/how-to-master-the-art-of-confidence">mastering the art of confidence</a>.</p>]]>

<h4>Follow along as I learn guitar in just 8 weeks with Halo Sport 2, the brain stimulator for musicians. </h4>
<p>Guitar has always terrified me. I’ve been singing since I was five years old, but using my hands to make music? That’s completely different.</p>
<p>This summer, I was looking for a challenge, so I partnered with Halo Neuroscience to face my fears and finally learn guitar. I’ll be using their headset, called <a href="https://www.haloneuro.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Halo Sport</a>, to accomplish my guitar goals. Halo Sport improves muscle memory through <a href="https://www.haloneuro.com/pages/science" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">neurostimulation</a> — which basically means I turn into a superhuman who can learn movement faster.</p>
<p>Like the name suggests, Halo Sport was originally built for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnzP5zX8rEo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">athletes</a>. That is, until this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVUvgUSX9hU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">concert pianist</a> discovered it — and learned a Bach prelude in only 1 hour. That’s what got me thinking... could Halo Sport help people trying to learn an instrument for the first time, too?</p>
<p>I’ll be putting this question to the test and using Halo Sport to learn guitar for the first time — in just 8 weeks. </p>
<p>I love the idea of bringing my guitar to a friend’s house and impressing everyone with my newfound skills. So, that’s my goal. I’ll be testing myself to see if I can learn two songs this summer: “Drive” by Oh Wonder and “Dreams” by Fleetwood Mac. Oh — and I’ll be performing them in just 8 weeks, so the pressure is on.</p>
<p>Here’s to starting my journey, let’s get to work!</p>
<p>Follow along as I start my adventure, and challenge yourself to learn a new instrument too. You never know what you could accomplish in just 8 weeks. Get <a href="https://www.haloneuro.com/products/halo-sport-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Halo Sport</a> and start unlocking your inner musician today!</p>

      <![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align: left;"><b>A guide to optimizing your life in the city.  </b></h3>
<p>From morning spin class to after-work drinks, the typical San Francisco resident is a busy one. So, how can you optimize your bustling lifestyle when there are only 24 hours in a day? One word: <strong>Neuropriming</strong>. Neuropriming with <a href="https://www.haloneuro.com/products/halo-sport-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Halo Sport</a> allows your brain to learn faster, so you can get more out of your limited time. That means a more <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iOFRegiHDg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">productive workout at the gym</a> or a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVUvgUSX9hU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">better music practice session</a>.</p>
<p>As a young professional in San Francisco, I decided to take Neuropriming to the streets and find the best spots to train my brain. Here are my top three destinations: </p>
<h3>1. BART</h3>
<p>Commuting is a major part of city life. The average Bay Area commuter spends about 30 minutes a day getting in or around the city. If you’re a morning person, Neuropriming on BART is the perfect way to start your day. <a href="https://youtu.be/sOIk0LQsoO0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prime for 20, train for 60</a>, and head to work feeling more refreshed and accomplished than ever.</p>
<p>       <img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0037/7965/7840/files/BART_1_large.jpg?v=1562621468" alt="" width="212" height="282">           <img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0037/7965/7840/files/SF_Blog_Photo_large.JPG?v=1563822970" alt="" width="245" height="327">                                         </p>
<h3>2. PHILZ</h3>
<p>A San Francisco classic, Philz Coffee was founded in the Mission in 1978. Grab a cup of coffee (the mint mojito is a personal favorite) and start Priming. Once you've finished your Neuropriming session (and your coffee), <a href="https://youtu.be/B7ZLWZbPrqY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">grab your guitar</a> and head to the park for a quick practice session. Neuropriming puts your brain in a state of hyperlearning, so you can master that riff you've been trying to learn in no time.</p>
<p>             <img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0037/7965/7840/files/IMG_0729_large.JPG?v=1562621264" alt="" width="190" height="337">                     <img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0037/7965/7840/files/IMG_0730_large.JPG?v=1562621293" alt="" width="175" height="311">   </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>3. DOLORES</h3>
<p>Change your mindset, change your life. With the park as your background, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10rA4TygTb4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">practice yoga or pilates</a> after Priming. With both your mind and body in an optimal state, you can master even the most difficult yoga flow.</p>
<p>        <img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0037/7965/7840/files/Dolores_2_large.jpg?v=1562621457" alt="" width="207" height="276">    <img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0037/7965/7840/files/dolores_1_large.jpg?v=1562621443" alt="" width="282" height="211"></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now it’s your turn — try my favorite spots, or find your own Priming sanctuary. Let us know where you end up on Instagram, and don’t forget to tag us <a href="https://www.instagram.com/haloneuroscience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@HaloNeuroscience</a> for a chance to be featured on our page.</p>

      <![CDATA[<p>Neuroscientists like to use the phrase <a href="http://www.historyofinformation.com/detail.php?id=3902" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“neurons that fire together, wire together”</a> to explain how learning happens in the brain. Let's unpack it.</p>
<p>To learn anything, it’s not enough for just one neuron to fire — many neurons need to fire at the same time.</p>
<p>The first time you try something new — whether you’re shooting free throws or learning times tables — your neurons have a weak connection. They don’t know how to talk to each other efficiently yet.</p>
<p>After a lot of repetition, these neurons build a strong connection — they wire together. When one neuron fires, the other neurons fire, <i>automatically</i>.</p>
<p>This explains how any skill becomes automatic — through practice and repetition.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.haloneuro.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">neurostimulation</a>, neurons fire more often, so they’re more likely to fire together — and wire together. That means your free throws or times tables will become automatic in less time.</p>
<p>Neurostimulation <a href="https://www.haloneuro.com/pages/science" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">accelerates learning</a> — so you need less practice time and fewer repetitions to master any skill.</p>

      <![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">Today, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5445139/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">85% of adults</a> in the U.S. use chemicals to change their brains in pursuit of happiness, energy, focus, and everything in between.</p>
<p>But when you try to change the brain with chemicals — like coffee, adderall, and antidepressants — you can’t control what part of the brain the chemical interacts with. That’s why side effects are so prevalent — chemicals affect the parts of the brain they need to <i>and</i> the parts of the brain they don’t.</p>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p>What if there was a different way to talk to the brain — one with no crash, no insomnia, and no addiction potential?</p>
<p><strong>There is... Electricity.</strong></p>
<p>Did you know the brain is an electric organ? Everything that happens in the brain is a result of electricity flowing from one place to another.</p>
<p>So why don’t we talk to the brain with electricity instead? Some people think it’s scary to add electricity to the brain — but actually, you’re speaking the brain’s language.</p>
<p>That’s exactly what <a href="http://info.haloneuro.com/transcranial-direct-current-stimulation/"><strong>transcranial direct current stimulation</strong></a> (tDCS) does. tDCS is a non-invasive form of brain stimulation that uses electricity to change the brain. It can even target a specific area of the brain, so only the part of the brain that needs help, gets it.</p>

      <![CDATA[<p><strong>Press Release, San Francisco, CA, January 8, 2019</strong> – San Francisco-based human performance company <a href="https://www.haloneuro.com/" title="Halo Neuroscience" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Halo Neuroscience</a> changed lives across the globe when it debuted Halo Sport, the first brain stimulator that accelerates muscle memory development. Today, the company announced the launch of Halo Sport 2, a fully upgraded Halo Sport at a price that makes neurostimulation more accessible to all.</p>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p><span>“In the new Halo Sport, Bluetooth audio is now integrated for an entirely wireless experience, and audio quality is in line with high-end headphones. We also revamped the Primer form factor to make Neuropriming as easy as possible, and the Halo Sport app to feature tracking, reminders, and new content,” said Halo Neuroscience CEO and co-founder, Dr. Daniel Chao. “From the beginning, we’ve been committed to making Neuropriming accessible to everyone, so Halo Sport 2 will retail for $399 — the same price as a pair of Beats Pro.”</span></p>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p>After celebrating 250,000 Halo Sport training sessions worldwide and landing partnerships with Equinox and TRX in 2018, Halo Neuroscience has proven that the appetite for neurostimulation extends far beyond the elite athletes that initially adopted the technology. The goal of Halo Sport 2 is to provide the same benefit to all athletes, musicians, and gamers as it has for elite athletes: the ability to do more in less practice time and reach higher levels of performance.</p>

<p name="92dd" id="92dd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">In athletics, explosiveness refers to the neuromuscular system’s ability to generate high action velocities. It is critical for quick movements such as sprints and jumps. Because maximum strength cannot be reached during rapid motion, sprinters focus primarily on increasing the<em class="markup--em markup--p-em"><span> </span>rate<span> </span></em>of force development (RFD) in the early stage of contraction. Rapid movements require contractions that happen on the timescale of 50–200ms, but it generally takes 300–500ms to develop peak strength.</p>

</div>
<figcaption class="imageCaption"><em>Maximum strength is not reached until 500ms, so rapid movements (50–200ms) are improved via RFD.</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<p name="c420" id="c420" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">This isn’t to say that relative strength is not important. In fact, it is absolutely essential to first develop strength, as we discussed in our previous post on<span> </span><a href="https://haloneuro.myshopify.com/blogs/halo/athlete-guide-brain-strength" data-href="https://blog.haloneuro.com/the-athletes-guide-to-the-brain-strength-175ae2ab46a9#.kfqygapki" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">strength</a>. Nonetheless, the law of diminishing returns applies — i.e. sprinters shouldn’t get so strong that speed is sacrificed for strength.</p>
<h4 name="aa98" id="aa98" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">Strides Above the Rest</strong></h4>
<p name="516f" id="516f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">OK — so strength is a key component of explosiveness, but why are legends like Bolt so much faster than the average sprinter? The answer may be as simple as physiology. Humans and other mammals have two types of muscle fibers, slow-twitch and fast-twitch. Slow-twitch fibers are typically recruited during movements requiring endurance. Fast-twitch fibers, on the other hand, are employed during fast, explosive motions.</p>
<p name="fe5d" id="fe5d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To understand the function of the two types of fibers, it’s helpful to imagine (bear with me!) the dark and white meat of a chicken. The dark meat — i.e. legs and thighs — is composed primarily of slow-twitch fibers, and allows the animal to complete slower movements such as walking. White meat — i.e. breast and wings — is composed mostly of fast-twitch fibers, which allows the chicken to execute short bursts of activity such as flying away from a predator.</p>

</figure>
<p name="16e3" id="16e3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">While the average person might possess mostly “dark meat” in their lower body, Bolt’s leg muscles more closely resemble those of a cheetah. Cheetahs have a very high proportion of fast-twitch fibers in their back and hind limbs, a characteristic that allows them to go from 0–60 mph in 3 seconds. A 1981<span> </span><a href="https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/abstract/10.1055/s-2008-1034603" data-href="https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/abstract/10.1055/s-2008-1034603" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">study</a><span> </span>published in the International Journal of Sports Medicine found that athletes with a higher percentage of fast-twitch fibers were able to run significantly faster during a 40-meter sprint. You can bet that this finding applies to Bolt. He possesses a disproportionately large amount of fast-twitch fibers in his lower body, which gives him lightning speed in short sprints. Bolt’s quickest 100 m was a record 9.58 seconds. Although a cheetah could run that distance in 3 seconds, Bolt’s record isn’t bad in comparison to Earth’s fastest animal.</p>

<p name="0c86" id="0c86" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Even though Bolt possesses a natural propensity towards the development of cheetah-like muscle fibers, this in no way prevents committed athletes from cultivating explosiveness through training. Beyond improving relative strength, athletes preparing for sprints should also train to optimize fast-twitch activation and increase RFD.<span> </span><span class="markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other" name="64d8715ea7eb" data-creator-ids="f4d3224ad815">Increased RFD is achieved through repetitive high-speed, short distance sprints, which effectively<span> </span><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">increases the speed of signal transference from the brain to the muscles</strong>.</span><span> </span>This is supported by a Danish<span> </span><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12235031" data-href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12235031" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">study</a><span> </span>published in the Journal of Applied Physiology, which discovered that the rate of EMG rise during resistance training is closely correlated with contractile RFD.<span> </span><span class="markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other" name="231879aba72c" data-creator-ids="f4d3224ad815"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">In other words, the greater the brain activity, the greater the RFD, which results in faster muscle fiber activation.</em></span></p>

<p name="cf5d" id="cf5d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Here’s how it works. By wearing Halo Sport during your workout, you place your brain in a state of optimal excitation, which accelerates its ability to rapidly recruit fast-twitch fibers. This translates to an increased rate of force development and ultimately results in improved explosive strength. We demonstrated this principle early in our in-house research, where we found that healthy participants who wore Halo had a significantly higher rate of force development compared to sham both during and after an isometric lateral pinch force task.

<p name="aa83" id="aa83" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you’re an athlete, it’s a no-brainer (get it?) that the key to improving athletic performance is training. Typically we understand athletic training as a physical routine that involves strengthening and coordinating relevant muscles in order to achieve a desired result. However, physical training is only part of the story. In fact, one of the most important areas to train isn’t a muscle at all. It’s the brain.</p>
<h4 name="64e6" id="64e6" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">The Mechanics</h4>
<p name="1b83" id="1b83" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">So how does the brain improve athletic performance? The brain provides what is known as<span> </span><a href="https://www.haloneuro.com/science" data-href="https://www.haloneuro.com/science" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">neural drive</em></a><span> </span>to the body. This is the electrical signal sent from the brain to the muscular system, which activates muscle fibers that are responsible for generating<span> </span><span class="markup--quote markup--p-quote is-me" name="911b204219b3" data-creator-ids="d91f2ec11128">power</span>. When an athlete trains, neural drive from the brain is strengthened, which increases the number of muscle fibers activated- also known as improved motor unit recruitment.</p>

<figcaption class="imageCaption"><em>Motor unit recruitment</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<p name="1319" id="1319" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">When motor unit recruitment increases due to a stronger electrical signal, the result is larger gains in strength, explosiveness, and dexterity. In addition, a better-timed electrical signal causes more adaptive coordination of motor units, which means improvements in precision, fine motor control, and hand-eye coordination.</p>
<h4 name="9e96" id="9e96" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Body Over Brain</h4>
<p name="931a" id="931a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Despite the brain’s strong influence over motor performance, technology relating to athletic training has primarily focused on enhancing athletic performance peripherally rather than strengthening motor unit recruitment — which makes sense. The brain is extremely complex and very difficult to study.</p>
<p name="6427" id="6427" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Scientists have been working for decades to understand exactly how the brain interacts with the muscular system and how these interactions could potentially be enhanced with technology. It’s a lot easier to build a machine that will strengthen the body physically than to build a device that involves changing the wiring of the brain and nervous system. However, since muscles <em class="markup--em markup--p-em"></em>would not even be able to contract without an electrical signal driving motor units, it’s clear that a brain-training technology would be an extremely valuable tool to enhance athletic performance. Nevertheless, simply sitting and wearing a device that increases neural drive will have absolutely no effect on athletic performance. Why?</p>
<p name="acf5" id="acf5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Muscles must be active in order for neural drive to be strengthened, which means that the<span> </span><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">body<span> </span></em>and the brain must be trained simultaneously.</p>
<h4 name="3181" id="3181" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Neuropriming as a Solution</h4>
<p name="3f7c" id="3f7c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">So, training the brain is tough. But is it possible? At Halo Neuroscience, we’re doing just that. Our first product —<a href="https://www.haloneuro.com/get-halo-sport" data-href="https://www.haloneuro.com/get-halo-sport" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Halo Sport </a>— is a headset that uses pulses of energy to improve the brain’s response to training. When paired with athletic training, Halo Sport causes stronger, more direct connections to be formed between neurons and muscles, i.e. strengthened neural drive. We refer to this mechanism as<span> </span><a href="https://www.haloneuro.com/science" data-href="https://www.haloneuro.com/science" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Neuropriming</em></a>. Similar to the way a pre-workout meal fuels the body, Halo Sport primes the brain to power the most effective workout.</p>

<p name="a237" id="a237" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">When motor units are strengthened and coordinated more precisely via Neuropriming, there are an infinite number of possibilities in terms of how motor performance can be improved, whether throwing a football to greater lengths, or recognizing a baseball pitch with greater speed. However, recruiting more muscle fibers is only part of the magic of Halo Sport.</p>
<p name="10fe" id="10fe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Neuropriming also improves the brain’s natural processes for learning and retaining information, which means that the gains made with Halo Sport will be maintained long after a Neuropriming session. We refer to this mechanism as<span> </span><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">hyperplasticity.</em><span> </span>Sounds complex and it is. We’ll go more in depth into this next week. For now, we’ll leave you with this: at Halo, we believe neuroscience and athletic training are inherently intertwined. We also believe that the Neuropriming technology of Halo Sport can allow athletes to unlock hidden potential and accelerate athletic gains in unprecedented ways.</p>

<p name="1168" id="1168" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">In our<span> </span><a href="https://haloneuro.myshopify.com/blogs/halo/athlete-guide-brain" data-href="https://blog.haloneuro.com/the-athlete-s-guide-to-the-brain-an-introduction-38fe5da41c0c" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">last post</a>, we began exploring the brain’s role in improving athletic performance. We discussed the concept of<span> </span><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Neuropriming,<span> </span></em>a method that strengthens brain-muscle connections (i.e. neural drive) when paired with athletic training. Neuropriming temporarily enhances motor performance, but increasing neural drive alone doesn’t equate to maintaining improvements. To achieve this result, the brain’s capacity for long-term learning and memory must be harnessed. At Halo, we’ve designed our first product to accelerate the brain’s natural learning processes. The result? Long-term maintenance of athletic gains. We refer to this mechanism as<span> </span><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">hyperplasticity.</em></p>
<h4 name="3dae" id="3dae" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Rewiring the Brain</h4>
<p name="f473" id="f473" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">To explain how hyperplasticity works, we’ll first have to dive into the<span> </span><span class="markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other" name="775013b5bbe3" data-creator-ids="dc435427fd04">nitty</span>-<span class="markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other" name="86d40f6830a3" data-creator-ids="dc435427fd04">gritty</span><span> </span>of some basic neuroscience principles. When our brains develop during childhood and adolescence, neurons are being generated that make and optimize connections very rapidly.</p>
<blockquote name="b3b9" id="b3b9" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p">The creation of neural pathways allows us to learn and acquire memories.</blockquote>
<p name="dfee" id="dfee" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">For many years, scientists believed that the number of neurons and neural networks created during a lifetime was finite, and that once the brain fully developed, the amount of rewiring that could be done was extremely limited. However, recent research has debunked this theory, and studies have shown that even elderly people can generate new neural pathways and increase their capacity for learning and memory. Simply put, our brains are malleable, moldable,<span> </span><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">plastic</em>. Thus, it makes sense that this phenomenon of rewiring the brain is known as<span> </span><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">neuroplasticity.</em></p>
<h4 name="b8ec" id="b8ec" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Practice Makes Perfect</h4>
<p name="38cd" id="38cd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">So how does neuroplasticity relate to athletic training? Well, every time you learn a new skill, whether it is shooting a basket, kicking a field goal, or perfecting a golf swing, you are using your brain’s potential for neuroplasticity. The first time you try a new skill, the connections between the brain and the specific set of muscles required for that skill are not optimized. However, the more you practice, the more robust and refined that neural pathway becomes, with more neurons and muscle fibers being recruited and coordinated in the correct pattern.</p>

</figure>
<p name="79ab" id="79ab" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">These plastic changes in the brain yield physical improvements relating to the skill. If you continue to practice, the optimized brain-muscle output will be maintained and so will the skill, but if you neglect practice, the functional connections will become less synchronous, resulting in poorer performance. So, there really is a reason why your mother always told you that practice makes perfect. It all comes down to neuroplasticity.</p>
<h4 name="87f2" id="87f2" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Accelerated Gains</h4>
<p name="3976" id="3976" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Neuroplasticity is a natural phenomenon that occurs during the acquisition of any new skill. It’s common sense that if you practice something, you will get better at it. However, it is also common knowledge that improvement takes<span> </span><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">time,<span> </span></em>sometimes painstakingly long amounts of time. What if there were a way to reduce the time element? Enter Halo Sport. When a Neuropriming session is paired with athletic training, the brain is primed to more quickly generate and strengthen neural pathways. We refer to this phenomenon as<span> </span><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">hyperplasticity</em>.</p>
<blockquote name="8106" id="8106" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p">In essence, Halo Sport speeds up your brain’s<span> </span><em class="markup--em markup--pullquote-em">natural</em><span> </span>ability to generate and optimize new neural pathways.</blockquote>
<p name="7d13" id="7d13" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">It is important to realize that completing one or two workouts with Halo Sport will not make you a pro overnight. Practice will always be required to consolidate a skill, so in order to realize accelerated gains over the long term, Halo Sport must be used regularly in combination with daily athletic training. If Halo is used sporadically or infrequently, the additional gains experienced will be small and temporary. However, if Neuropriming is integrated into daily athletic training, gains will be acquired and maintained at an accelerated rate.</p>

<h3 name="d8e2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At the end of a run, your brain is sending weaker signals to your muscles, so you feel fatigued. With Halo Sport, your brain learns to maintain stronger signals throughout the run.</h3>
<p name="d8e2" id="d8e2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Usain Bolt’s rocketship <a href="https://haloneuro.myshopify.com/blogs/halo/athlete-guide-brain-explosiveness">explosiveness</a> has made sprints wildly popular, but what about Bolt’s contemporaries in the longer races — athletes who can run a 26 mile marathon in just over 2 hours? That’s less than 5 minutes per mile — a mind-boggling feat, considering that the fastest single mile ever was run in just under 4 minutes.</p>
<p name="d8e2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">How is this humanly possible? Though running seven, ten, or even twelve miles a day is of course critical, most athletes don’t realize that the development of endurance is largely influenced by — you guessed it —<strong> the brain</strong>.</p>
<h4 name="104f" id="104f" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">Classical Theories of Endurance</strong></h4>
<p name="5c39" id="5c39" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Theories of endurance traditionally focus on cardiovascular, respiratory, metabolic, and muscular mechanisms. That is, endurance is typically viewed as a factor of physiological characteristics such as pulmonary ventilation, cardiac output, and lactate threshold.</p>
<p name="5a13" id="5a13" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Of course, genetics and environment play a large role in how these physiological traits develop. For example,<span> </span><a href="http://www.runnersworld.com/rt-web-exclusive/the-ethiopiakenya-running-phenomenon" data-href="http://www.runnersworld.com/rt-web-exclusive/the-ethiopiakenya-running-phenomenon" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kenyans and Ethiopians</a><span> </span>have come to dominate middle-and long-distance Olympic events, and the fastest marathon ever was run in 2:02:57 by<span> </span><a href="https://twitter.com/DennisKimetto" data-href="https://twitter.com/DennisKimetto" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dennis Kimetto</a><span> </span>of Kenya.</p>
<p name="f6a9" id="f6a9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The reason? Kenyans and Ethiopians possess a unique blend of genetics that provides favorable adaptations for an endurance lifestyle. Beyond genetics, Kenyans and Ethiopians also run and walk extensively at an early age, so their bodies become<span> </span><span class="markup--quote markup--p-quote is-me" name="b13b6b935bd6" data-creator-ids="d91f2ec11128">heavily</span><span> </span>conditioned for endurance.

<p name="b5a5" id="b5a5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Although environment and genetics largely dictate the endurance profile of an athlete, the real key to success in endurance sports is training. Take<span> </span><a href="https://twitter.com/G_Rupp" data-href="https://twitter.com/G_Rupp" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Galen Rupp</a>, for example, a 30 year old Portland, OR native who practiced endurance training tirelessly for over 14 years and won the 2016 American Olympic trials with a 2:11:11 marathon, in his<span> </span><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">first marathon ever.<span> </span></em>Rupp does not possess the genetic makeup or environmental background of a runner like Kimetto (though it’s possible he shares some of the same genetic polymorphisms), but he’s still managed to develop highly competitive levels of endurance through years of focused endurance training.</p>
<p name="1dcd" id="1dcd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The fact that both Rupp and Kimetto are competitive endurance athletes negates the possibility that endurance is completely due to favorable physical characteristics invoked by genetics or environment. That’s why a purely physical understanding of endurance is incomplete. There is something more fundamental that Rupp and Kimetto both have the ability to train, and that is: the brain.</p>
<p name="341d" id="341d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The brain is a critical common denominator across elite endurance athletes of all backgrounds, so all athletes can benefit equally from training this fascinating organ.</p>
<h4 name="a357" id="a357" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">The Brain’s Role in Endurance</strong></h4>
<p name="8cf8" id="8cf8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Many athletes don’t realize that the brain plays a big role in endurance. Scientists, however, have long known that the brain plays a role in fatigue and exercise tolerance. As early as 1890, Italian scientist Angelo Mosso published a<span> </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fatigue-1906-Hardcover-Angelo-Mosso/dp/B011OI61AE?ie=UTF8&amp;*Version*=1&amp;*entries*=0" data-href="https://www.amazon.com/Fatigue-1906-Hardcover-Angelo-Mosso/dp/B011OI61AE?ie=UTF8&amp;*Version*=1&amp;*entries*=0" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">book</a> providing preliminary evidence regarding the effects of cognitive activity on fatigue. According to Mosso, two of his fellow physiology professors experienced reduced muscular endurance after giving a series of lectures and oral exams to students.</p>
<p name="b20f" id="b20f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">More recently, a 2009<span> </span><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19131473" data-href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19131473" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">study</a><span> </span>published in the Journal of Applied Physiology found that<span> </span><span class="markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other" name="20c86615fc18" data-creator-ids="8fb172c68880">cognitive fatigue</span><span> </span>limits athletic performance — individuals who performed heavy cognitive tasks before a time-to-exhaustion cycling task could only cycle for an average of 640 seconds, while individuals who did not perform cognitive tasks were able to cycle for an average of 754 seconds.</p>

</figure>
<p name="b385" id="b385" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Despite its role in endurance, the brain has been overlooked in endurance training, primarily because endurance is measured by physiological changes such as heart rate, stroke volume, and oxygen transport. Coaches typically focus on cardiovascular and respiratory components of training in order to optimize these qualities. However, because of the brain’s prominent role in exercise tolerance, it makes sense that a more deliberate and focused training of the brain could allow endurance athletes to take long-distance sports to an entirely new level.</p>
<p name="9a31" id="9a31" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In order to unlock the secrets of brain training as it relates to endurance, let’s first build an understanding around the neurological mechanism that regulates fatigue.</p>

Peripheral fatigue is the type of fatigue targeted through traditional endurance training. Central fatigue has hardly been recognized in athletics, although athletes naturally address central fatigue during classical endurance training without realizing it. Although both types of fatigue result in decreased performance capacity of the muscles, they follow different mechanisms.</p>

<p name="8981" id="8981" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Peripheral fatigue is defined as a transient decrease in a muscle group’s capacity for exercise. This can be caused by a number of factors, including reduced pulmonary ventilation, metabolite depletion, or reduced cardiac output. To put it into context, peripheral fatigue is what causes runners to start gasping for breath at the end of a long-distance run, and is responsible for “the burn” felt by cyclists at the the top of a hill.</p>

<h4 name="b4c7" id="b4c7" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">Excitation vs. Inhibition</strong></h4>
<p name="29e5" id="29e5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">If the reduction of excitatory brain activity is the neural mechanism of central fatigue, the maintenance of excitatory brain activity becomes the neural mechanism of endurance. Neuroscientists have identified a precise neural circuit that explains an athlete’s ability to fend off central fatigue. There are two distinct phases of this circuit, inhibition and facilitation.</p>
<p name="72eb" id="72eb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The inhibition phase is as follows:</p>
<ol class="postList">
<li name="c199" id="c199" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Sensory inputs from the peripheral system sends an inhibitory signal up the spinal cord to the primary motor cortex.</li>
<li name="27ca" id="27ca" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">The primary motor cortex reduces motor output via increased activity of inhibitory GABA receptors. It alerts other brain areas to follow suit, which cumulatively signals the body to reduce motor activity. Brain regions involved in this circuit constitute the inhibition system.</li>
</ol>
<p name="f1a0" id="f1a0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">Let’s walk through these steps in plain terms. The first step is essentially the body letting the brain know that it feels tired. We can think of this as<span> </span><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">perceived exertion</em>. This could come in the form of heavy breathing, muscle cramps, “the burn,” etc.</p>
<p name="534b" id="534b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The second step is when the brain gets the signal that the body is tired, which gives the body the green light to slow down. If the athlete slows down, the heart rate will decline, the breath will slow, and movement will weaken. However, if the athlete still has enough energy to keep going, the inhibition signals can be minimized. To do this, an athlete invokes the second part of the circuit, the facilitation (i.e. excitation) phase.</p>
<p name="fe64" id="fe64" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The facilitation phase is as follows:</p>
<ol class="postList">
<li name="8609" id="8609" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Cortical inputs send an excitatory signal to the primary motor cortex.</li>
<li name="45df" id="45df" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">The motor cortex increases motor output to the peripheral system in order to counteract the inhibitory signal. This allows motor activity to be maintained at the same level instead of dropping off due to fatigue. Brain regions involved in this circuit constitute the facilitation system.</li>
</ol>
<p name="48a1" id="48a1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">Again, in plain terms, the first step is the athlete’s ability to continue exercising.</p>
<p name="d2aa" id="d2aa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The second step is when this ability gets translated into action, i.e. the brain signals the body to keep the muscles moving, the heart rate up, and the breath heavy so that the athlete can<span> </span><span class="markup--quote markup--p-quote is-me" name="b69500b7f2b8" data-creator-ids="d91f2ec11128">keep</span><span> </span>going.</p>
<p name="d9ed" id="d9ed" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">While the facilitation system does an excellent job of fending off central fatigue, an athlete can only exercise for so long. After long periods of exhaustive exercise, eventually the body uses up all available resources and reaches its<span> </span><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">true exertion</em><span> </span>potential, at which point the athlete must terminate activity.</p>
<h4 name="a6a1" id="a6a1" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">Research Points to the Benefits of Neurological Training</strong></h4>
<p name="8880" id="8880" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">By repetitively practicing long-distance exercises, athletes naturally train their brains to fend off fatigue, which steadily builds endurance over time. However, there are more gains to be had than those achieved through endurance training alone. Even while running marathons at near sprinting pace for mere mortals, endurance athletes are only activating a small fraction of their brain’s excitatory capacity with traditional long-distance training methods.</p>
<p name="7dc6" id="7dc6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The good news is that scientists have found that training the brain through neurostimulation can significantly increase the body’s capacity for endurance. In this way,<span> </span><span class="markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other" name="fe3ada98febd" data-creator-ids="1f3759847545">endurance athletes can push their perceived exertion potential closer to their true exertion potential.</span></p>
<p name="af56" id="af56" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A number of academic articles have confirmed brain stimulation as an effective method to increase endurance. By inducting plasticity in the brain, neurostimulation trains the brain to maximize excitatory signals and minimize inhibitory signals in order to help athletes maintain the same level of exertion for longer periods of time.</p>
<p name="3ad7" id="3ad7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For example, a recent<span> </span><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17614951" data-href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17614951" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">study</a><span> </span>from a group of Italian scientists at the Universitá di Milano found that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the motor cortex increases both cortical excitability and time to exhaustion in an isometric elbow flexion exercise.

<p name="38bf" id="38bf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Most athletes are familiar with the basics of traditional strength training science. When athletes lift weights, they’re essentially creating minuscule tears in muscle tissue. The body responds to this damage by adapting to and repairing these tears — “adapting” in this case means more muscle mass, and “repairing” means stronger tissue. This biological mechanism is known as<span> </span><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">hypertrophy</em>.</p>

<p name="8477" id="8477" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Although most athletes are somewhat familiar with the concept of hypertrophy, the mechanism is an extremely simplified macro-model of strength. At a microscopic level, muscles are made of fibers bunched into groups, innervated by a single motor neuron. A group of muscle fibers plus a motor neuron is called a<span> </span><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">motor unit</strong>, and when activated by the neuron, all of the muscle fibers in the unit contract.</p>
<p name="0483" id="0483" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Because the number of activated motor units determines the force of a muscle contraction, a muscle will produce a greater force if more groups of motor units are activated<span> </span><span class="markup--quote markup--p-quote is-me" name="ade4d8e712b2" data-creator-ids="d91f2ec11128">simultaneously</span>.

<p name="d048" id="d048" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At the NMJ, the electrical signal is converted into a chemical signal that causes the muscle fibers to contract.

<p name="2596" id="2596" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">There’s actually a very good reason to listen to coaches that insist practice makes perfect:<span> </span><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">the brain loves repetition</strong>. Brian Shaw didn’t become the strongest man in the world overnight. Rather, he lifts everything from weights to small SUVs at least four times a week to prepare for a competition. This commitment to repetitive training strengthens neural drive, which increases motor unit activation and results in greater strength production.</p>
<p name="4808" id="4808" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">However, reps alone are not worth anything if the wrong form is used. If Shaw did deadlifts with no regard for proper form, his brain would activate the the wrong muscle fibers and strengthen incorrect pathways. By using the right movement to build strength — every single rep — the brain learns to fire the correct muscles in the right order.</p>
<h4 name="001d" id="001d" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">Three Secrets Regarding the Brain’s Role in Strength Training</strong></h4>
<p name="61d0" id="61d0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Research in the field of neuroscience has continuously validated the crucial role of neural drive and repetition in strength training. The literature repeatedly points to three fundamental conclusions that all athletes need to be aware of:</p>
<ol class="postList">
<li name="9b03" id="9b03" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"><span class="markup--quote markup--li-quote is-other" name="4dbd8b93c373" data-creator-ids="f4d3224ad815">Athletes naturally train their brains during a workout. However, athletes who fail to focus specifically on neurological training while working out are limiting their athletic potential.</span></li>

<li name="92ac" id="92ac" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><span class="markup--quote markup--li-quote is-other" name="cf9912b1cb14" data-creator-ids="f4d3224ad815">When combined with strength training, neurological training comes with the additional benefit of “cross-education” — i.e. training the brain to more effectively strengthen one muscle group indirectly strengthens contralateral muscle groups.</span></li>
</ol>
<p name="8e77" id="8e77" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">In regards to the first point, it is important to understand that all athletes naturally strengthen neuromuscular circuitry through the act of working out. However, if athletes only train their body and don’t target the brain specifically, the brain does not activate muscles to their full capacity. This means that even the most elite, skilled athletes have room to improve, regardless of their strength training program.</p>
<p name="814e" id="814e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">According to a <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15049717" data-href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15049717" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">study</a> published in Sports Medicine by Australian scientist<span> </span><span class="markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other" name="b6ef2ef33a1a" data-creator-ids="f4d3224ad815">Dr. Anthony Shield, the brain rarely activates all motor units in a muscle group at once, even if an athlete is pushing his or her muscles to their maximum. However, with repetitive strength training, the brain does learn to activate motor units in a more synchronous manner, and the deficit decreases over</span><span class="markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other" name="b6ef2ef33a1a d3a68aac78f1" data-creator-ids="f4d3224ad815">time.</span><span class="markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other" name="d3a68aac78f1" data-creator-ids="f4d3224ad815"><span> </span>Nevertheless, it is unlikely for an athlete to achieve maximum strength with physical athletic training alone</span>. If athletes wish to come close to their true athletic potential, they must find methods to more thoroughly activate motor units.</p>

<p name="da3f" id="da3f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Furthermore, a group of scientists from the University of New South Wales in Sydney Australia published a scientific<span> </span><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17043329" data-href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17043329" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">review<span> </span></a>observing that the contralateral strength training effect is 8% of initial strength — or about half the increase in strength of the trained side.<span> </span><span class="markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other" name="441572e4d6a0" data-creator-ids="f4d3224ad815">Therefore, by training the brain alongside the body, athletes have the unique opportunity to accelerate improvements not only in the trained muscle and corresponding motor pathways, but also in the pathways activating the untrained limb</span>.</p>

After five weeks of training, the group wearing Halo Sport during their workouts saw an increase in lower body strength of 12 percent, as measured by the Air Squat, Counter Jump, and Squat Jump.</p>
<p name="7fa9" id="7fa9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Compare that to the control group, which only saw an increase of 0–4 percent.</p>
<p name="1222" id="1222" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Another partnership with the U.S. Olympic Ski and Snowboard Team produced excellent results for Olympic Ski Jumpers looking to increase propulsive force:</p>

<p name="6ec4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But of course, athletes have more tools available to them than just raw power. A huge focal area for the pros involves decreasing the time it takes to develop maximal force — what is commonly known as “explosiveness.” More on this in our next installment — <a href="https://haloneuro.myshopify.com/blogs/halo/athlete-guide-brain-explosiveness" data-href="https://blog.haloneuro.com/the-athletes-guide-to-the-brain-explosiveness-44df6179acfc" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Athlete’s Guide to the Brain: Explosiveness</a>.</p>

<h3 name="540a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">To play guitar or sink a putt, your brain has to send signals to the correct muscles in a specific order. With Halo Sport, your brain needs fewer reps to perfect that process.</h3>
<p name="540a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Neuroplasticity — the fascinating, moldable nature of the brain — is the force behind all learning. It's what allows athletes and musicians to learn and perfect motor skills — finely coordinated muscle movements like putting and playing guitar.</p>
<p name="540a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">This week, we’ll go deeper into the science behind motor skill learning and discuss how<span> </span><a href="https://www.haloneuro.com/" data-href="https://www.haloneuro.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Halo Sport</a><span> </span>can tap into our brain’s natural ability to acquire new skills.</p>
<h4 name="704e" id="704e" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--h4-em">Breaking it Down</em></h4>
<p name="904e" id="904e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Motor skill learning is defined as the process by which movements are executed more quickly and accurately with practice. Motor skills are acquired over multiple training sessions until performance reaches a plateau. There are two phases of learning: a fast phase and a slow phase. The fast phase involves rapid improvement over the course of one single training session. The slow phase involves small, steady gains that develop over multiple practice sessions, eventually reaching a stable peak.</p>
<blockquote name="a610" id="a610" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">For example, if you’ve never shot a free throw before, the first time you practice will be the most learning-intensive, as you are coordinating muscles in a way that your body has never experienced before.</blockquote>
<p name="3a37" id="3a37" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Once that first session is over, you are cognitively aware of much of what is required to make the shot, you’re just not very good. In your subsequent practices, you begin the slow process of gaining accuracy so that the vision in your brain matches the movements of your body. Eventually, you’ll reach a level of expertise that is relatively constant.</p>

<p name="8eb8" id="8eb8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">In addition to the division between fast and slow, motor skill acquisition can be separated into stages across another axis:</p>
<ol class="postList">
<li name="dc21" id="dc21" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Encoding</li>
<li name="a3b3" id="a3b3" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Consolidation</li>
<li name="cb1a" id="cb1a" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Retention &amp; Recall.</li>
</ol>
<p name="a1d2" id="a1d2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">Encoding overlaps with the fast learning period and refers to the process by which a motor skill is converted from an experience to a construct that is stored in the brain. The majority of encoding will occur online<em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> </em>— or the interval<span> </span><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">during</em><span> </span>training sessions.</p>
<p name="6e1f" id="6e1f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In contrast, skill consolidation happens offline<em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> </em>— or the interval<span> </span><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">between</em>training sessions. Sleep is a critical offline period; it’s when the majority of skill learning is consolidated in the brain. Consolidation can be thought of as an intermediate phase between fast and slow learning.</p>
<p name="5b04" id="5b04" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The last stage of learning, retention, occurs simultaneously with the slow learning phase, during both offline and and online periods.The result of retention is the commitment of the learned skill to muscle memory and the ability to retrieve this memory at will. Muscle memory refers to the ability to perform a skill without any conscious effort.</p>
<p name="b5cc" id="b5cc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For example, every time Steph Curry shoots a free throw, the movement is effortless. He’s practiced that particular skill so many times that it’s been retained as muscle memory, so he is able to retrieve the memory and complete the movement automatically with no thought required.</p>

<p name="9138" id="9138" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">So where in the brain does motor skill learning take place? That’s a complicated question. Each phase of learning involves different brain areas ranging from lower-level visual and perceptual regions (these perform the nuts-and-bolts processing) to higher-order cortical areas that integrate and synthesize information. However, one brain region that is specific to motor learning is the primary motor cortex, or M1.</p>

<p name="f125" id="f125" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The primary motor cortex is responsible for the conscious initiation of voluntary <em class="markup--em markup--p-em"></em>movements. It is activated both during the fast stage and the slow stage of learning. Once a skill is committed to muscle memory, the motor cortex is less involved, and activation switches to lower-order processing areas such as the cerebellum where subconscious motor memories are stored. This reflects the behavioral shift that occurs as the motor skill improves — i.e. less and less reliance on thinking until the skill can be completed with no conscious effort.</p>

      <![CDATA[<p>Neuroscientists like to use the phrase <a href="http://www.historyofinformation.com/detail.php?id=3902" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“neurons that fire together, wire together”</a> to explain how learning happens in the brain. Let's unpack it.</p>
<p>To learn anything, it’s not enough for just one neuron to fire — many neurons need to fire at the same time.</p>
<p>The first time you try something new — whether you’re shooting free throws or learning times tables — your neurons have a weak connection. They don’t know how to talk to each other efficiently yet.</p>
<p>After a lot of repetition, these neurons build a strong connection — they wire together. When one neuron fires, the other neurons fire, <i>automatically</i>.</p>
<p>This explains how any skill becomes automatic — through practice and repetition.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.haloneuro.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">neurostimulation</a>, neurons fire more often, so they’re more likely to fire together — and wire together. That means your free throws or times tables will become automatic in less time.</p>
<p>Neurostimulation <a href="https://www.haloneuro.com/pages/science" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">accelerates learning</a> — so you need less practice time and fewer repetitions to master any skill.</p>

    <title>Can Electricity Replace Drugs?</title>

      <![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">Today, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5445139/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">85% of adults</a> in the U.S. use chemicals to change their brains in pursuit of happiness, energy, focus, and everything in between.</p>
<p>But when you try to change the brain with chemicals — like coffee, adderall, and antidepressants — you can’t control what part of the brain the chemical interacts with. That’s why side effects are so prevalent — chemicals affect the parts of the brain they need to <i>and</i> the parts of the brain they don’t.</p>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p>What if there was a different way to talk to the brain — one with no crash, no insomnia, and no addiction potential?</p>
<p><strong>There is... Electricity.</strong></p>
<p>Did you know the brain is an electric organ? Everything that happens in the brain is a result of electricity flowing from one place to another.</p>
<p>So why don’t we talk to the brain with electricity instead? Some people think it’s scary to add electricity to the brain — but actually, you’re speaking the brain’s language.</p>
<p>That’s exactly what <a href="http://info.haloneuro.com/transcranial-direct-current-stimulation/"><strong>transcranial direct current stimulation</strong></a> (tDCS) does. tDCS is a non-invasive form of brain stimulation that uses electricity to change the brain. It can even target a specific area of the brain, so only the part of the brain that needs help, gets it.</p>
